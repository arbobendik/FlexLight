example_1 (with textures) test page: https://arbobendik.github.io/web-ray-tracer/example_1.html

use the raytracer in your project as a javascript library (raytracer.js).
There is no official documentation yet. For code examples look at example_0.js or example_1.js.

(Safari & IE unsupported due to a lack of WebGl2 support).
